  <strong>Are different from average people?</strong>
  <br>
  <strong>Is your identity not fully expressed yet?</strong>

  <h3>We are here for you uWu!</h3>

  <p>We want to give you that push to freely express yourself and
  unleash your inner weeb. To establish your identity and finding yourself
  is our ultimate mission! As you get older and you have to make the decision about
  what you'll become and often we don't even know it yet. We don't get enough
  time to discover ourselves and find our true path. This one is dedicated for
  anime/manga lovers, gamers, twitch streamers, language learners, people who
  are interested to learn about different cultures, and k-pop fans.
  Kimono きもの Studio is the place where we unite as one, have fun,
  share our stories, and make a lot of amazing friends!
